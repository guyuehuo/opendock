About OpenDock
===================
OpenDock based on Python and PyTorch. This framework supports the integration of multiple scoring functions, 
some of which can be utilized during molecular docking and pose optimization, while others can be employed 
for post-processing scoring. In terms of sampling, the current version of this framework supports simulated 
annealing and Monte Carlo optimization. Additionally, it can be extended to include methods such as genetic 
algorithms and particle swarm optimization for optimizing docking poses and protein side chain orientations. 
Distance and angle constraints are also implemented to allow covalent docking or constraints guided pose sampling.

Overall, this framework serves as a valuable tool in drug design and small molecule modeling, 
offering great flexibility for most of the protein-ligand complex docking and modelling tasks.
